This folder contains a library I developed during my PhD. 
'include' folder contains all header files. 
'src' folder contains all source C files. 
Makefiles for each individual file has '.mk' extenstions.
Object files are in '.o' extension. 
Even thought the file names are pretty much self-explanatory, 
here is a short summary:
u3b.f			: RMSD calculation with Kasch Method.
rc_functions  	  	: Various functions to calculate different reaction coordinates.
aa_functions	  	: Functions related to essential amino acid properties like 3 letter codes, 
			  1 letter codes, mass, charge, volume.
distance_functions	: Distance calculation functions for different structures. 
form_factors		: Atomic X-Ray scattering form factor calculation functions. 
stat_functions		: Averaging, standard deviations etc. functions. 
waxs_functions		: Functions I developed to calculate WAXS intensities with Makowski's method. 
rmsd_functions		: A bunch of functions for RMSD calculation and superimposition of protein structures.
blast_functions		: Sequence alignment functions of Dr. Wenjun Zheng. 
lapack_blas_functions	: They are not lapack or blas functions. They are functions that I use to solve a linear equation 
			  system w/ Lapack or Blas. 
pdb_io			: The name says pretty much everything. Input-output routines for Protein Data Bank files.
time_functions		: Self explanatory. 
aa_form_factors		: Functions I used to calculate amino acid form factors. 
enm_functions		: All functions related with Elastic Network Model.
pair_functions		: Pair distribution functions I wrote for SAXS-based flexible fitting. 
nd_functions		: Normalized distance function. Please see DOI: 10.1007/s10822-015-9849-0 for details.
